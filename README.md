Our third piece is an announcement to some undergraduates, predominantly students of Computer Science, at Yale University. It is on display on Marcus' email account and the accounts of anybody who received or was forwarded, bcc'd, etc. It documents the first opportunity electronic mail was used during the course of the project to recruit collaborators from a targeted population (in this case, _nerds_, man)
