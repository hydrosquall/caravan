Welcome to The Caravan - A Cycling-Activist Performance Art Piece Exhibiting in Branford College, Downtown New Haven, The Internet, and potentially [your venue](mailto:marcusrussi+caravan@gmail.com). A framework and example of a modern, hyper-local, highly reproducible, community-oriented, open-source social movement. Currently evolving at the speed of the internet connections of Caravan's contributors.

Our first piece was finished on Monday afternoon, and is currently on display on the Facebook Timeline of [Marcus Russi](https://www.facebook.com/marcus.russi).

We are in need of individuals available to:

- Contribute oral histories of their experiences as Dwight-area residents, as they pertain to street traffic and its impact on pedestrian, cyclist, child, and resident safety. We are particularly interested in oral histories from current or former residents who are _not_ current students at Yale College ("undergrads").
    - Please keep in mind that your oral history will be published on [caravannewhaven.org (currently a dead link, check back soon)](https://caravannewhaven.org).
    - Contact [Marcus](mailto:marcusrussi+caravan@gmail.com) if you are still interested!
- Conduct informal literature reviews concerning the physical health and mental health benefits of being a regular cyclist
    - Do you have prior experience doing literature reviews on determinants of health, burden of disease, or urban transit (__or a strong interest__)? Get in [touch](mailto:marcusrussi+caravan@gmail.com)!
- Conduct informal literature reviews concerning the outsize amount of risk taken on by recreational cyclists and cyclist-commuters, and its impact on life-expectancy, untimely death or debilitating injury due to a motorist-bicyclist collision.
    - Do you have prior experience doing risk analysis or risk management, analysis of disease or social burden, etc.? Get in [touch](mailto:marcusrussi+caravan@gmail.com)!
- Research strategies for digital archival in the open-source, version controlled environment and make recommendations to The Caravan
    - Do you hold an MLS or related degree? Are you a geek about digital archival and directing its future towards the development and use of open-source, accessible tools? Get in [touch](mailto:marcusrussi+caravan@gmail.com)!
- Based on these recommendations, implement a small set of digital archival techniques within the Caravan GitHub repository
