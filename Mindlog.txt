- [Marcus Russi] I can't sleep so I got out of bed, my friend went back home, and I spent an hour reorganizing file structure and adding to README.md to prepare for onboarding this week. Time to go to CVS to get some melatonin cuz I can't find my bottle!!
- [Marcus Russi] If you choose to burn the midnight oil, I think that Flux (https://justgetflux.com/) is not only a great piece of software to keep your eyes from getting totally fried, but also an example of a community coming together around a tool and supporting not just its development as a cross-platform application, but also as a platform for discussion of the effect that increased human use of LED/LCD screens has on our ability to sleep well at night.
- [Marcus Russi] There are so many links just on root/README.md and I'm starting to get worried that I will accidently break one of them. I wonder if there's a tool to scan GitHub repos and notify you of broken links in README.md files, or other files containing hyperlinks.
- [Marcus Russi] I think the repository is ready to show Yale professors. Michelle Liu gave me a couple Nyquils so I no longer need to bike to CVS!
